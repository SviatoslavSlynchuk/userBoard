#User Board
This is a simple demo project to show small interactions with 3-rd party API.
It allows you to get the list of personnel and check their on-boarding progress.

To run the project locally you need to check out repository onto your local machine.
Then, in root folder just run:
```
npm run start
```
It will run webpack-dev-server in watch mode.

This app has no connection to the LocalStorage, so there is no ability to sync your state between few browser tabs.

Also, there is no unit or integrtion tests implemented.
